Tetris
======
Created in Java

There are 5 programs that run Tetris, and all of them work at the current moment

#TetrisNewMechanics.java
```console
$ Tetris with mechanics that work the second you input them
$ Has problems with multithreading and allocation of data
$ No music
```

#TetrisNewMechanicsSound.java
```console
$ Tetris with mechanics that work the second you input them
$ Has problems with multithreading and allocation of data
$ Has music implementation, but you would need to find the music somewhere else
$ Name the music file "music.wav"
$ Place it into the project folder
$ If you don't want to change the music file name the code for the filename is on line 53
```

#TetrisOldMechanicsSound.java
```console
$ Tetris with mechanics that update every frame
$ Has a problem where inputs are not being read
$ Has music implementation, but you would need to find the music somewhere else
$ Name the music file "music.wav"
$ Place it into the project folder
$ If you don't want to change the music file name the code for the filename is on line 53
```

#TetrisTesting.java or TetrisViewer.java
```console
$ These are the same file, just was too lazy to put the exception on the .gitignore file
$ I used two files, one for debugging
$ Tetris with mechanics that update every frame
$ Has a problem where inputs are not being read
$ No music
